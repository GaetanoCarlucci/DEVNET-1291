# DEVNET-1291
DevNet Classroom - Kubernetes IKS with Intersight Service for Terraform


This session is your first step towards the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) journey for modernizing and standardizing your hybrid cloud operating model which will help you reduce costs on infrastructure management. You will learn the benefit of the IaC approach for delivering common use cases to your on-prem infrastructure such as deploying a Kubernetes cluster on-prem that hosts a containerized application. The IaC provisioning will be carried out by the Integration of the Cisco Intersight platform and HashiCorp Terraform For Cloud.
